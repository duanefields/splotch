VMS? yuck!
I hope you don't actually like VMS!
Vaxen are nasty!
vms is lame
-barf- vms, *gag*, sputter
VMS is usually quite secure
try logging in as FIELD, password SUPPORT hehe!
How old is VMS anyhow?!
I was forced to use a vax once, it was horrible
a vax? too bad
why use VMS, when you could use UNIX?
why not unix?
why vms?
vax? running vms?
what version of vms?
I am not a big fan of VMS
I shall NEVER use vms
vms is of the devil
I run VMS on my C64!
Why is vms still around?
