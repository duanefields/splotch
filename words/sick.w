*sniffle*
*cough*
I thank I am running a fever!
ugh my stomach hurts
my head is spinning
I can't feel my hands
everything is blurry
Oh, I am definitely gonna be ill
*yack* 'scuse me
*sneeze* ugh
I think its a cold
could be the flue
I think its too much beer
I imagine a lack of sleep has made me sick
I'm sick as a @animal.w
too sick to do homework!
too sick to study!
much too sick to care
*eats a rolaids*
*eats some asprin*
*takes @number.w tylenol*
